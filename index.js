Although we have our ups and downs, and some frequent quarrels im glad that we still stood side by side together and overcome these problems together as one, the furthest event i can think that we did together was the SPOH interviews, i remember you waiting outside as my interview timing was slightly later than you, i remember seeing you so quietly and patiently doing work, it made me want to have you as my girlfriend, fast forward then we went to SPSU interview together and SPSU assessment day together those were fun, although throughout the whole thing i was just tryna find you and i even went home just to get my laptop that was fun, you even brought me wingstop so kind. Another memorable time was on my birthday. I was so happy you planned everything and prepared everything, it was the best birthday celebration I had. Thank you for always being there for me and a shoulder to cry on. I love you 🙂\""
